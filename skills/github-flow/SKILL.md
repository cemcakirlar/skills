# GitHub Flow

Automate the full GitHub issue-to-production lifecycle through a unified CLI script (`scripts/flow.sh`) and standardized GitHub CLI/GraphQL patterns.

This skill connects three separate GitHub systems into a single seamless loop:

1. **Repository Git & PRs** (`git` + `gh pr`)
2. **Issue Tracking & Project Boards** (`gh project` + GitHub Projects v2)
3. **Continuous Deployment** (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, or custom webhooks)

    A[0. next] --> B[1. start <issue>]

```

| Step         | Command                                          | What It Does                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0. Next**  | `./scripts/flow.sh next [--start]`               | Lists open backlog issues, displays next candidate in queue, and optionally starts work.                                         |
| **1. Start** | `./scripts/flow.sh start <issue_no> [slug]`      | Syncs default branch, sets Project board status to **In Progress**, and creates `feature/<slug>` branch.                         |
| **2. Check** | `./scripts/flow.sh check`                        | Runs project verification gates (typecheck, tests, build) and shows git status.                                                  |
| **3. PR**    | `./scripts/flow.sh pr <issue_no> [title] [body]` | Commits changes, pushes branch, opens PR, and links PR to issue via GraphQL.                                                     |
| **Link**     | `./scripts/flow.sh link <issue_no> <pr_no>`      | Standalone command to link any PR to an issue via GraphQL.                                                                       |
| **4. Ship**  | `./scripts/flow.sh ship [pr_no]`                 | Squash-merges PR, deletes remote branch, syncs local default branch, marks board item **Done**, and triggers deployment webhook. |
| **Deploy**   | `./scripts/flow.sh deploy`                       | Standalone trigger for the deployment webhook (`POST`).                                                                          |
| **Status**   | `./scripts/flow.sh status`                       | Displays active branch, associated PR, and project board link.                                                                   |

## Step Chaining & Agent Response Rules (MANDATORY)

To guarantee high engineering velocity and maintain clear conversational context, **every step in the `github-flow` lifecycle deterministically points to the next command**.

### Transition Rules

| Step Completed            | State / Context                                  | Next Command to Run / Recommend     |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **0. `next`**             | Backlog issue reviewed/selected                  | `pnpm flow start <issue_no> [slug]` |
| **1. `start <issue_no>`** | Feature branch created, code changes ready       | `pnpm flow check`                   |
| **2. `check`**            | Quality gates passed (typecheck, tests, build)   | `pnpm flow pr <issue_no> "[title]"` |
| **3. `pr <issue_no>`**    | PR created and linked to issue                   | `pnpm flow ship [pr_no]`            |
| **4. `ship [pr_no]`**     | PR merged, branch deleted, default branch synced | `pnpm flow next [--start]`          |

### AI Agent Reporting Requirement

Whenever an AI agent completes a step or presents a status summary (e.g. after running `flow check` or `flow start`), **it MUST always append the next command to execute immediately below its summary report**:

````markdown
### Sonraki Adım / Next Step
```bash
pnpm flow <next_command>
```
````

Agents must never end a status report without this explicit next step block.

---

## Configuration (`.flowrc`)

`github-flow` works zero-config on standard repos, but can be tailored per repository using a `.flowrc` file in the repository root.

```bash
# .flowrc

# GitHub Projects v2 Integration (Optional)
PROJECT_NUM="5"
PROJECT_OWNER="cemcakirlar"
STATUS_FIELD_NAME="Status"
STATUS_IN_PROGRESS_NAME="In Progress"
STATUS_DONE_NAME="Done"

# Quality Verification Gate (Optional)
# If omitted, flow.sh auto-detects from package.json, Makefile, or Cargo.toml
CHECK_CMD="pnpm -r --parallel run typecheck && pnpm build"

# Deployment Webhook (Optional)
# Triggered via POST on `ship` and `deploy`
if [[ -n "${REPO_ROOT:-}" && -f "$REPO_ROOT/.secrets" ]]; then
  source "$REPO_ROOT/.secrets"
fi
DEPLOY_HOOK_URL="${DEPLOY_HOOK_URL:-https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/workers/builds/deploy_hooks/YOUR_DEPLOY_HOOK_UUID}"

# Branching Conventions (Optional)
DEFAULT_BRANCH="main"
BRANCH_PREFIX="feature/"
```

See `references/flowrc.example` for a complete template.

## Adopting in a New Repository

1. **Install or vendor the skill**: Ensure `github-flow` exists in your `.agents/skills/` directory.
2. **Add an alias (optional but recommended)**:
   In `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "flow": "bash .agents/skills/github-flow/scripts/flow.sh"
   }
   ```
   Or execute directly: `bash .agents/skills/github-flow/scripts/flow.sh <command>`.
3. **Configure (optional)**: Create `.flowrc` if using GitHub Projects v2 boards or deploy hooks.
4. **Document in `AGENTS.md`**:

   ```markdown
   ## Issue workflow

   Use `pnpm flow` (`.agents/skills/github-flow/scripts/flow.sh`) for issue lifecycle:

   - `pnpm flow start <issue_no>`
   - `pnpm flow check`
   - `pnpm flow pr <issue_no> [title]`
   - `pnpm flow ship [pr_no]`
   ```
